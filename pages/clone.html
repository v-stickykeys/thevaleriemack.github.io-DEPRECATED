            <p>Clone Combat is a game that I created with classmates for our Analytics-Driven Game Design course. I came up with the concept for this puzzle platformer where the player has to defeat clones who mirror each of the player's inputs in real time. We successfully executed our ideas, creating three iterative versions that improved over each design cycle.</p>

            <p>My primary roles were user interface and user experience designer.</p>
            <p>After analyzing our data from play testers, I concluded that our greatest design challenge was learnability, so I created comprehensive tutorial levels that increased player engagement. (See slides on top right and bottom left.)</p>

            <p>Clone Combat was one of the most successful games produced from our class. It was featured on Newgrounds and received a 3.5 / 5 rating and over 20,000 plays in the first week. With a tougher audience on Kongregate, we received a 3.1 / 5 star rating.</p>
